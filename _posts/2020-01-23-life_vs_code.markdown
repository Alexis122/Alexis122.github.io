Learning to code for me has become a lot like learning a second language (when you think about it, that's exactly what we're doing!). Like conversing with someone fluent in another language, it can be challengeing at times, not knowing how to immediately respond back and what not. I do find myself retracing my footsteps through our lessons and refreshing my brain on how to respond or start a conversation with my computer (again, a lot like picking up a book to refresh your brain on how to say "How are you?" in italian (it's "come stai"). Reading back on our work and lessons have been very helpful for me to learn our new language!
