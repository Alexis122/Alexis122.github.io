It all started a few decades ago…

At the age of 6 I became fasincated with computers and would spend hours upon hours a day trying to pick them apart from the inside (playing around with files and what not). Luckily, my father worked at an electronics store so he would bring home a few different computers a year.

One day, when I was playing The Sims, my computer crashed and no matter what I did I couldn’t get it back up and running. I went into the computer files and tried to clean out everything the best I could. Next thing I know, I restarted my computer and my Sims were up & running! I had to be around 8 at this time. Still till this day I’m not 100% sure what I did, but it worked. I’d continue mindlessy debugging my computer while growing up & dowloading files on my computer (from like limewire & bearshare, yeah we all know how badly that messed up our computers at one point or another).

Fast foward to sophore year high school, finally the year I get to choose an elective! What did I end up choosing? Crafting? Tech? Writing?

I chose Tech! This was my chance to get some real training, and experiment with code. Our first class started with learning basic HTML code (also thanks to MySpace, we’re all pretty much experts on this ;), a few classes later we began building our own webpage, next thing I know I created this glittery masterpiece, and it was 100% mine.

I think that’s what I love most about coding. The creative possibilites are endless.
