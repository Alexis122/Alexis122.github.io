What I like and dislike about hashes.

Hashes, hashes, hashes oh my! What fun (and extreme madness) it's been experimenting with these. I like using Hashes because it's a long the lines of a dictonary, one thing feeds into another..etc..It can make something so easy.

What I dislike about Hashes, is that it can get a little confusing and turn into a challenging mess if you just keep adding unnecessary stuff. 

I'm still experimenting with them and in no way do I feel secure enough to use Hashes without any instruction, but as everything, it will take some time!
